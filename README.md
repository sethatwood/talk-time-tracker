# Talk Time Tracker

## For time-blind people who talk too much.

Ever found yourself overshooting your time during interviews, presentations, or even casual conversations? You're not alone. Talk Time Tracker is here to save your speech by keeping you within your time limits - politely nudging you when it's time to wrap up.

### Why Talk Time Tracker?

In a world where time flies, especially when you're talking, we often lose track of how long we've been speaking. Whether you're practicing for an interview, giving a presentation, or just mindful of not dominating conversations, keeping track of your talk time is essential. That's where Talk Time Tracker comes in - your friendly, on-screen reminder to keep it concise.

### Features

- **Simple Setup**: Get started in seconds. No complicated configurations needed.
- **Customizable Countdown**: Default set to 90 seconds, but easily adjustable for any talk length.
- **Visual Cue**: Timer turns yellow in the final 30 seconds, signaling you to start wrapping up. It then turns red when you've exceeded your time, providing a clear visual indicator to conclude.
- **Immediate Reset**: Big reset button to quickly start over for your next practice or speech segment.
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes, perfect for late-night practice sessions or if you're just a fan of dark mode.

### Getting Started

1. **Visit the App**: Simply go to `https://sethatwood.github.io/talk-time-tracker/` to start using Talk Time Tracker.
2. **Set Your Time**: Use the default 90 seconds or adjust to your preference.
3. **Talk Away**: Keep an eye on the timer, and wrap up when it turns red. If you go over, no worries, just see how far you've gone and try to do better next time.
4. **Reset and Repeat**: Hit the big reset button to start again.
